# Developer

## Installation using Git

For a git based installation you'll need a `composer install` on the module root in order to fetch dependencies.
If the module is packaged in a zip with dependencies, change PHP version on your development server to the minimal requirement (see https://docs.humhub.org/docs/admin/requirements) for the minimal Humhub version in module.json, and then update dependencies with `composer update`
